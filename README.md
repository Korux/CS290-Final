Goal:

For this assignment, our goal was to create a website that could celebrate the 150th anniversary of OSU.
We wanted to capture something where everyone could bring their own personality and put it into a canvas.
Thus, we came up with the idea to create a website where you could draw what you wanted and posted it on the website.
There are four different tabs that include the "Home-Tab", "All-Posts-Tab", "Add-Post-Tab", and lastly, the "Browse-Tab".
There is also a "Search-Bar" that you may use.

What They each Contain:

"Home-Tab": This is the default tab for when you load the website. This tab shows a brief description of where/what OSU is, a
couple of interesting facts, and lastly a slideshow of photos that Matthew took of different parts of campus.

"All-Posts-Tab": This tab contains all the posts on the server. At any time you may like a post by pressing the like or dislike button, or if you are
intrigued, you can press on the image can comment or like.

"Add-Post-Tab": This tab contains the elements to create a new post. There is a canvas that you can draw on and just to the right of the canvas there is a little tool section and a
little section to add a title and write who the author is. When you have completed both the required information, you can press post and it takes you to the page that includes all the posts.

"Browse-Tab": This tab is a sort-of show-off tab. It contains three of the top liked posts, three of the top disliked posts, and three random posts. As with any of the other pages, you can
press on the image and it takes you to the comment page.

"Search-Bar": For the search bar you can search any of the posts by title or author. If there are no similar posts, then the page displays a "No Posts Were found.".

In conclusion, we hope that you enjoy the website and help celebrate the 150 year anniversary of OSU. Go to the "Add-Posts-Tab", get your mouse ready, put your beret on, and get ready to draw!

What is Lorem Ipsum?
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

Why do we use it?
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).


Where does it come from?
Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

Where can I get some?
There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
